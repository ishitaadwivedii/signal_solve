# Signal Solve: A Comprehensive Audio Processing Web Application  

## Overview  
Signal Solve is an advanced **web-based audio processing tool** designed to help users with **background noise removal, text-to-speech conversion, and speech-to-text transcription**. Developed using **Streamlit**, the application integrates powerful Python libraries to enhance user experience.  

## Features  
- **Background Noise Removal**: Uses advanced algorithms to remove unwanted noise from audio recordings.  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts written text into synthesized speech using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API**.  
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Transcribes spoken words into text using **Python's SpeechRecognition library**.  
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, ensuring an intuitive and accessible design.  

## Project Architecture  
The application follows a **modular architecture** that includes:  
1. **User Interface** ‚Äì Developed using **Streamlit**.  
2. **Audio Processing Modules** ‚Äì Implements **noise reduction, TTS, and STT functionalities**.  
3. **Data Handling** ‚Äì Supports **uploading, processing, and downloading** audio files.  


## Methodology & Implementation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Background Noise Removal
- Uses **Pydub** for audio file processing.
- Applies **Noisereduce** library to remove unwanted background noise.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Implements **Google TTS (gTTS)** for text conversion into speech.
- Allows users to adjust voice settings.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Uses **SpeechRecognition library** to convert spoken words into text.
- Supports multiple languages for transcription.


## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed:
```bash
python --version
```

## Project Roadmap & Future Enhancements
‚úÖ **Completed Features**
- Web-based **noise reduction, TTS, and STT** tools.
- Support for **multiple audio formats**.

üöÄ **Planned Features**
- **Live microphone feed processing** for real-time transcription.
- **IoT device integration** (e.g., smart headphones, Raspberry Pi).
- **Web extension** to allow on-the-go usage without a full app installation.
